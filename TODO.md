# Appenv â€• to-do list

- [ ] Use shellcheck to test
- [ ] `append list`, `appenv (load) <name>`, `appenv unload <name>`
- [ ] Add logging functions 
- [ ] Implement reverse API to undo changes
- [ ] Support naming of appenvs and automatic unloading of them
- [ ] Try to implement the core commands in bash so that they're shell-agnostic and don't need to be reimplemented for each shell.
